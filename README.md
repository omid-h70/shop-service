# Welcome To Go Shop Service 
Go Shop Service is a simple API for some actions, imagine you have a big shop, customers come and take sales, meanwhile
some purchases got delays on delivery system, we have designed a small system that customers can report a delay, 
an agent can handle a delay request and assign new time to it based on an external api,
finally you can make a report request to see vendors how has delays based on minutes within last 7 days

## Software Architecture
This is an attempt to implement a clean architecture, and some other design patterns such as adapter, singleton, composition in combination
## Requirements/Dependencies
- Docker
- Docker-compose
- golang:1.18-alpine docker image
- mysql docker image
##  Getting Started
we have simple makefile in root of our project, currently makefile works on Windows, other systems will be added soon
`make clean` 
will do everything for you to come up and running
